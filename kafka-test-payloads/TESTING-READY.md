# 🎉 Exchange Service Testing - READY TO GO!

**Date:** 2025-01-10
**Status:** ✅ ALL SYSTEMS GO

---

## ✅ Verification Complete

All prerequisites have been verified and are working:

- ✅ **kcat installed** at `/opt/homebrew/bin/kcat`
- ✅ **Kafka running** on `localhost:9092` (KRaft mode - no Zookeeper)
- ✅ **Topic exists** `orders.v1`
- ✅ **Java 17** installed and working
- ✅ **Maven 3.9.11** installed and working
- ✅ **OrderBook refactored** into 8 component classes
- ✅ **All 8 test payloads** ready (46 test orders total)
- ✅ **Test scripts** executable and ready

---

## 🚀 Start Testing in 2 Steps

### Step 1: Start Exchange Service

**Terminal 1 - Start the Application:**
```bash
cd /Users/karirakesh/Documents/Apexon/ExchangeService
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Wait until you see:
```
Started ExchangeServiceApplication in X.XXX seconds
```

### Step 2: Run Tests

**Terminal 2 - Run Automated Tests:**
```bash
cd /Users/karirakesh/Documents/Apexon/ExchangeService/kafka-test-payloads

# Run ALL tests (recommended first run)
./quick-test.sh all

# Or run specific tests
./quick-test.sh limit      # Limit orders
./quick-test.sh market     # Market orders
./quick-test.sh stop       # Stop loss orders
./quick-test.sh stoplimit  # Stop limit orders
./quick-test.sh trailing   # Trailing stops
./quick-test.sh iceberg    # Iceberg orders
./quick-test.sh oco        # OCO orders
./quick-test.sh tif        # Time in force (IOC/FOK/GTC)
```

**Terminal 3 - Monitor Logs (Optional):**
```bash
cd /Users/karirakesh/Documents/Apexon/ExchangeService
tail -f logs/application.log
```

## 📊 What Tests Will Run

| Test File | Orders | Validates | Expected Time |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 01-limit-orders.json | 4 | Price matching, FIFO, partial fills | ~10s |
| 02-market-orders.json | 4 | Market execution at best price | ~10s |
| 03-stop-loss-orders.json | 7 | Stop triggers at price level | ~15s |
| 04-stop-limit-orders.json | 6 | Stop-to-limit conversion | ~15s |
| 05-trailing-stop-orders.json | 7 | Dynamic stop adjustment | ~15s |
| 06-iceberg-orders.json | 4 | Hidden quantity reveal | ~10s |
| 07-oco-orders.json | 7 | OCO leg cancellation | ~15s |
| 08-time-in-force-tests.json | 7 | IOC/FOK/GTC behaviors | ~15s |

**Total:** 46 test orders, ~2 minutes for full suite

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators

**In quick-test.sh output:**
```
✓ Test 1: Limit Order Match - PASSED
✓ Test 2: Market Order Execution - PASSED
✓ Test 3: Stop Loss Trigger - PASSED
...
```

**In application logs:**
```
🧾 Processing OrderPlaced event - OrderId=1001, UserId=user1
Trade executed: 100 units between Order 1001 and Order 1002 at price 150.00
Stop order triggered: StopLossOrder{orderId='3003', stopPrice=148.00}
Cancelling OCO counterpart order: 7003-secondary from group OCO-GROUP-001
```

### 🔴 Potential Issues

**If you see errors:**
- Check logs with: `tail -f logs/application.log | grep ERROR`
- Ensure all orders have unique order IDs
- Verify timestamps are properly formatted

## 🧪 Refactored Components Being Tested

Your OrderBook has been refactored into these components:

1. **OrderQueue.java** - Manages buy/sell priority queues
2. **OrderMatcher.java** - Determines order matches and executions
3. **TradeExecutor.java** - Executes trades and creates execution records
4. **StopOrderManager.java** - Manages stop loss and stop limit orders
5. **TrailingStopManager.java** - Handles trailing stop adjustments
6. **OCOOrderManager.java** - Manages One-Cancels-Other order groups
7. **OrderPriceExtractor.java** - Utility for price extraction
8. **OrderBook.java** - Main orchestrator (refactored from 686 to ~400 lines)

## 🎯 Success Criteria Checklist

After running tests, verify:

- [ ] All 8 test files complete without errors
- [ ] Limit orders match at correct prices
- [ ] Market orders execute immediately
- [ ] Stop orders trigger at expected prices
- [ ] Trailing stops adjust with price movements
- [ ] OCO orders cancel counterparts when one leg executes
- [ ] IOC orders partially fill and cancel remainder
- [ ] FOK orders reject when insufficient liquidity
- [ ] No ERROR logs in application
- [ ] ORDER BOOK STATE logs show correct order placement

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First Run**: Use `./quick-test.sh all` to test everything
2. **Debugging**: Keep logs visible in separate terminal
3. **Reset**: Restart Exchange Service between major test runs
4. **Manual Testing**: Use `./manual-test-commands.sh` for step-by-step testing

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Kafka Issues
```bash
# Check Kafka status
brew services list | grep kafka

# Restart Kafka if needed
brew services restart kafka

# Verify connectivity
kcat -b localhost:9092 -L
```

### Application Issues
```bash
# Check if running
lsof -i :8080

# View recent errors
tail -100 logs/application.log | grep ERROR

# Restart application
# Stop with Ctrl+C in Terminal 1, then mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Test Issues
```bash
# Re-run verification
./verify-setup.sh

# Check individual test file
cat 01-limit-orders.json | jq .
```

---

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is configured and verified. Your refactored OrderBook is ready for comprehensive testing.

**Start with:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd /Users/karirakesh/Documents/Apexon/ExchangeService
mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2 (once app is started)
cd kafka-test-payloads
./quick-test.sh all
```

Happy Testing! 🚀
